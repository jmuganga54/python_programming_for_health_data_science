# Python Programming for Health Data Science

> Learning health data science and AI with Python

This repository contains **Python scripts and notebooks** designed to introduce the foundations of programming, data manipulation, and analysis in health data science.

It builds practical skills for working with real-world health data — from calculating BMI to building predictive models — while encouraging good coding practices, reproducibility, and ethical awareness.


### Why Python?

Python is popular because it is:

- **Readable** – the syntax is close to English  
- **Powerful** – libraries for statistics, machine learning, imaging, and more  
- **Flexible** – you can start small (like computing BMI) and scale to massive projects (like deep learning models)

When you learn Python, you are not just learning to *code* — you are learning the **language of modern data science and AI**.

## What is Health Data Science?

**Health data science** is the intersection of *medicine, statistics, and programming*.  
Health data scientists use data to:

- **Describe** – How many patients were admitted this week?  
- **Predict** – Who is at risk of complications after surgery?  
- **Explain** – Which factors drive higher readmission rates?  
- **Communicate** – How can results be shown clearly to clinicians?  

### Common Data Sources
- Electronic health records (EHRs)  
- Imaging (X-ray, MRI, CT)  
- Wearables and mobile apps  
- Genomic data  
- Public health surveys  

Python helps transform this raw data into **knowledge**, and ultimately into **better patient care**.

## Goals

* Get you up and running with `Python` and `Jupyter Notebook`  
* Introduce the basics of programming and data analysis in Python  
* Demonstrate workflows and reproducible practices used in health data science  
* Build confidence to move from simple scripts to real-world projects in AI and data science  


## Structure

Each topic or chapter is organised in its own folder.  
Within each folder, you may find:

- **Scripts** – Python files illustrating examples and exercises  
- **Notebooks** – Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning  
- **Data** – Practice datasets to support hands-on work  

Example:

```
chapter1/
├── scripts/
├── notebooks/
└── data/
chapter2/
├── scripts/
├── notebooks/
└── data/
```
