    "Welcome to Hackathon 01 of the Programing for Health Data Science Unit. In this Hackathon, we perform analysis on a dataset of aneurysms. We will read the data, explore it, and generate insights about aneurysms rupture. \n",
    "\n",
    "A brain aneurysm, also known as a cerebral or intracranial aneurysm, is a bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain (see Figure 1). This condition can lead to serious complications if the aneurysm ruptures, potentially causing haemorrhagic stroke or other neurological damage. \n",

    "Understanding the risk factors and characteristics associated with ruptured aneurysms is critical for improving patient outcomes and developing preventive strategies. Common locations of aneurysms include:\n",

    "Internal Carotid Artery (ICA): Supplies blood to the brain. Specific ICA segments include: ICA Ophthalmic (ICA Oph): Supplies the eyes. ICA Cavernous (ICA Cav): Passes through the cavernous sinus. ICA Tip: Bifurcation point into anterior and middle cerebral arteries.\n",
    "Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA): Supplies the lateral cerebral hemisphere.\n",
    "Vertebral Artery (VA): Part of the vertebrobasilar system, supplying the brain's posterior circulation.\n",
    "Basilar Artery (BA): Formed by the union of the vertebral arteries, supplying the brainstem and cerebellum.\n",
    "Anterior Communicating Artery (AComA): Connects the two anterior cerebral arteries and is a common site for aneurysms.\n",

    "In this task, we will calculate the PHASES score for each patient. The PHASES score is a clinical tool used to assess the risk of rupture in patients with intracranial aneurysms (see this [reference](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474442213702631?via%3Dihub) for more about PHASES). It takes into account several key factors, including Patient Ethnicity, Age, Hypertension, Size of Aneurysm, Location of Aneurysm, and History of Previous Bleeding. Each factor contributes to the overall score, which helps in stratifying patients based on their risk levels. Although our dataset lacks information on ethnicity, hypertension, and bleeding history, we can still calculate a modified PHASES score using the available attributes to better understand the potential risks associated with aneurysm rupture. Thus, our PHASES score is based on the following criteria:\n",
    "- **Site Score**: If 'Site' = A, score = 0; If 'Site' = B, score = 2; If 'Site' = C, score = 4.\n",
    "- **Age Score**: If 'Age' < 70, score = 0; If 'Age' >= 70, score = 1.\n",
